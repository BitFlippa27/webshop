# Web Shop

This is a almost fully functional Web Shop Application where you can login with Google or just your email. You can browse products and add them to a basket.
Finally you can pay by credit card which is powered by Stripe.
The app has different versions replicated as branches. I  started to implement state managment with React Context, then gradually upgraded to, Redux, Redux Thunk for asynchronous state management and finally Redux Saga the most powerful side effect management library.

Right now the entire code is migrating to TypeScript.
